* Broadcom USB controllers

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm3384-ohci", "brcm,bcm3384-ehci"
- compatible: "brcm,bcm7346-ohci", "brcm,bcm7346-ehci"
- compatible: "brcm,bcm7425-ohci", "brcm,bcm7425-ehci"

  These currently use the generic-ohci and generic-ehci drivers.  On some
  systems, special handling may be needed in the following cases:

  - Restoring state after systemwide power save modes
  - Sharing PHYs with the USBD (UDC) hardware
  - Figuring out which controllers are disabled on ASIC bondout variants
